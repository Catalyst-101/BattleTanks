# BattleTanks

**BattleTanks** is a survival-style game developed in C++ using the **SFML 2.6.2** library. Players control a tank and aim to score as many points as possible. Instead of a traditional level system, the game's difficulty increases over time by continuously adding more enemy tanks. The goal is to survive as long as possible and beat your high score.

> ⚙️ **Built with:** SFML 2.6.2  
> 💻 **Recommended IDE:** Visual Studio (not Visual Studio Code) for best compatibility and performance
